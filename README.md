# ✈️ Aviation Accident Risk Analysis (1962–2023)

A comprehensive analysis of aviation accidents between 1962 and 2023, focusing on aircraft types, causes, severity, and patterns over time.  
The goal is to **identify low-risk aircraft** and offer **strategic recommendations** for businesses entering the aviation industry.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to answer key safety-related questions and identify trends in aviation accidents to guide data-driven investment and policy decisions.

---

## 🔎 Key Questions

- ❓ What are the most common causes of aviation accidents?  
- ✈️ Which aircraft types have the highest and lowest accident rates?  
- 🌍 Are accidents more frequent in certain regions or time periods?  
- 🌦️ How does weather or flight purpose correlate with accident severity?

---

## 🔍 Technologies Used

- **Python 🐍** – for data manipulation and analysis  
- **Jupyter Notebook 📓** – exploratory analysis and visualization  
- **Pandas** – data wrangling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – statistical and comparative plots  
- **Plotly** – interactive visualizations  
- **Git** – version control  
- **PowerPoint** – stakeholder-friendly summary presentation

##📈 Results & Insights
###🛩️ Single-engine land aircraft have historically higher incident rates.

⛅ A significant portion of accidents are caused by pilot error, weather conditions, or mechanical failure.

✈️ Commercial and cargo flights are generally safer than private or instructional flights.

📅 Peak accident periods correspond to early decades and seasonal extremes (e.g., winter fog).

##🎯 Business Recommendations
✅ Invest in multi-engine aircraft with strong safety records.

🚫 Avoid aircraft models with frequent accidents in historical data.

🧠 Improve pilot training with emphasis on weather decision-making.

📊 Use historical heatmaps and patterns to guide route planning.
